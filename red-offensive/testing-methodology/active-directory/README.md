### Bloodhound Basics

* Uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and unintended relationships in an AD environment.
* Easily identity highly complex attack paths - can be used by defenders ad well.
* Bloodhound works by running an ingestor that queries AD for users, groups and hosts. It will then connect to each system to enumerate logged in users sessions and permissions. \*\*\*WARNING: VERY LOUD\*\*\* There is a stealth option but its limited.
* Two Verisons
  * BloodHound - Powershell based older module&#x20;
  * Sharphound - C# verision that is much faster and stable. Standalone binary or imported as a Powershell script.
    * Script version wil use reflection and assembly.load to load the compiled ingestor into memory
    * &#x20;[https://github.com/BloodhoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/ingestors](https://github.com/BloodhoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/ingestors)
* Multiple connection Methods you might need to specify
  * Group - group membership info
  * LocalGroup - Collect local admin info
  * Session - session info
  * SessionLoop - Continuously collection session info until killed
  * Trust - enumerate domain trust data
  * ACL - collect ACL data
  * ComputerOnly - local admin and session data
  * GPOLocalGroup - collects local admin info via group policy objects
  * LoggedOn - Collects session info using privileged methods (needs admin)
  * ObjectProps - collects node property info for users and devices.
  * Default - collects Group membership, local admin,sessions, and domain trusts
* Commands
  * Bloodhound.ps1\[sharphound.ps1] Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod \[method of choice]
  * \> Sharphound.exe -c \[method of choice]
  * After bloodhound finishes, it will drop the files on the victims system. Pull them on to your machine.
  * Next we need to start our correlation graph using Neo4j server and import the data
    * \# apt-get install bloodhound
    * \# neo4j console
    * Open browser to [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474)
      * connect to bolt://localhost:7687
      * username/pw = neo4j/neo4j
      * CHANGE PASSWORD
  * \# sudo bloodhound
    * Database URL: bolt://127.0.0.1:7687
    * Username: neo4j
    * Password: newpassword
    *
    * Upload data - all the created csv files
  * Neo4j allows for raw queries through its own language called Cypher
    * [https://blog.cptjesus/posts/introtocypher](https://blog.cptjesus/posts/introtocypher)
    * [https://porterhau5.com/blog/extending-bloodhound-track-and-visualize-your-compromise](https://porterhau5.com/blog/extending-bloodhound-track-and-visualize-your-compromise)
    * [https://github.com/porterhau5/BloodHound-Owned/blob/master/customqueries.json](https://github.com/porterhau5/BloodHound-Owned/blob/master/customqueries.json)
  * When using the ACL method, bloodhound will gather all permissions for users/objects
  * The info we gather from Access Control Entries describes allowed and denied permissions for users groups and comps.
