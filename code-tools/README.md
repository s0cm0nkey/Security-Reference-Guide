# Yellow - Code and CLI

You do not need to know how to code to be good at security. Many newcomers to the industry are daunted by the prospect of learning to code, which can prevent them from taking the plunge into cybersecurity. Does coding help? Absolutely! However, it is not a prerequisite for success. A foundational level of coding knowledge is perfectly acceptable.

Think of it like learning the basics of a foreign language. Does everyone need 4-5 years to become completely fluent in Spanish before ordering food at your favorite taco restaurant? No! Understanding some of the more common terms and being able to recognize the language when it's used goes a long way.\
The same applies to code.

To help with this foundational understanding, many platforms, tools, and projects have been created to make code more approachable. As a security analyst, you are not expected to write complex JavaScript or in-depth PowerShell commands. However, should you be able to recognize them and understand their function? Absolutely! Fortunately, there are tools that can make this process easier.
