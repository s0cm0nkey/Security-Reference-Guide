# Search Engines

## **Search Engines**

Cyber search engines are a beautiful set of tools that allow us to do research on specific targets as they relate to cybersecurity. Searching by IP, domain, vulnerability, etc. allows us to perform tasks ranging from passive recon as part of a penetration test, to threat intelligence research. Search.html - Your OSINT starting place.

When initiating a search on anything, the first stop is a bit of HTML whipped up by OSINT master Michael Bazzell. This handy tool allows an easy search of multiple sources with one click. I prefer this to other others as it allows me to manually parse the search page and go down rabbit holes from there.

Included Search Engines: Google, Google Date, Bing, Yahoo, Searx, Yandex, Baidu, Exalead, Duckduckgo, Startpage, Newsgroups, Blogs, FTP Servers, Indexes, Scholars, Patents, Qwant, News, Wayback, and Ahmia. Google is the most powerful and scary information gathering tool today. Beyond searching for basic keywords, adding in advanced commands can refine your results and reveal incredible amounts of information about your target.

These are by no means exhaustive, but they are a handy place to start.
