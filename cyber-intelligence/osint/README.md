# OSINT

## **Intro**

The focus of this section is to provide helpful resources for OSINT and Passive reconnaissance on a given target. There will be certain tools and sites you might be familiar with that could be applicable in this section, that I have omitted and with good reason.

1. This section is "Passive" recon, which does not entail touching or interacting with your target in any way. For offensive operations, staying off radar is key. But can we check with other sources that may have already scanned out target? You bet.&#x20;
2. There are many research tools that provide similar output to the ones listed in the later sections. The ones that I have specifically omitted (and will document in another section) are tailored more to defensive operations and contain information like reputation data and historical activity.

## **OSINT Resources**

<details>

<summary>OSINT Guides and Methodology</summary>

Specific for what you need to look for and how to find it, during the passive recon phase of a penetration test, or the proper way to OSINT.

* [IntelTechniques](https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook) - One of the best resources for OSINT has been Michael Bazzell's OSINT book and his website. I highly recommend you order his book. The HTML search tools I reference here come from his collection, available on his website for free. He also runs the Privacy and Security Podcast which is a highly recommended resource for both OSINT techniques and personal privacy.
* [https://ohshint.gitbook.io/](https://ohshint.gitbook.io/) - One of the most detailed OSINT resources available. Chocked full of search tools.
* [Security Sift ](http://www.securitysift.com/passive-reconnaissance/) - This write up is a great guide to Passive recon when preparing for a penetration test. For building up your own workflow, start with this.&#x20;
* [Pen Test Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Intelligence_Gathering) - Great guides for every step of a penetration test, but the recon section is especially useful as a reference here.&#x20;
* [OSINT\_Handbook\_2020.pdf](https://i-intelligence.eu/uploads/public-documents/OSINT_Handbook_2020.pdf) - OSINT Tools and Techniques by I-Intelligence
* [https://www.randhome.io/blog/2019/01/05/2019-osint-guide/](https://www.randhome.io/blog/2019/01/05/2019-osint-guide/) - Great guide of some newer tools and techniques.
* [https://nixintel.info/osint/using-gap-analysis-to-keep-osint-investigations-on-track/](https://nixintel.info/osint/using-gap-analysis-to-keep-osint-investigations-on-track/) - Great article on investigation methodology to hasten your OSINT research.
* Methodology of how to investigate a website - [https://twitter.com/aware\_online/status/1308312883248467975](https://twitter.com/aware_online/status/1308312883248467975)
* [OSINT x UCCU Workshop on Open Source Intelligence](https://www.slideshare.net/miaoski/osint-x-uccu-workshop-on-open-source-intelligence)  - Slide deck from a workshop by Miaoski, one of the Senior Intel Analysts for Trend Micro.
* [102 Deep Dive in the Dark Web OSINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzd3zkAI_o4) - Great video presentation on Dark Web OSINT techniques
* [Verification handbook](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/verification-3) - Designed for journalists but still quite useful, the Verification handbook provides a wealth of resources on investigative procedure

<summary>Volunteer OSINT</summary>

There are a few interesting organizations out there that take OSINT researchers and have them help with certain public good tasks like finding missing children or stopping pedophiles. It can be a heavy ask but can really do some good in the world with the skills that we have. Please check out and If you can donate some time to help, please do!
