<summary>Name Search</summary>

Name search records can become ambiguous quickly when dealing with common names like "John Smith". However, many tools allow you to refine searches with additional data points such as location or other contextual information.

A recommended starting point is Michael Bazzell's **Name.html** tool, which searches name databases and returns associated data points for building comprehensive target profiles. The next step is to search for public records associated with the name. Remember to use location data to provide additional context and improve search accuracy.
