# Username/Email

## Usernames and Email Addresses

Corporate usernames are beginning to be obnoxiously easy to guess and build. The standard of FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME@CORP.com is so common, it's ridiculous. Even more so when account management tools will simply take the first half of the email and reuse it as a username. We can use schemes like this to our advantage to search for a multitude of treasures like accounts on other services with the same username, credentials found in breaches, and associated sites or tools. When searching for usernames, you can uncover linked social media accounts and tons of relevant intelligence.

## Username and Email Address Analysis Tools

**Username.html and Email.html**

These two tools often go hand in hand with results often overlapping. Still, it is good habit to run the searches for both the username and the email address in case there is a discrepancy between the two. These two tools check for two things: presence of the username/email on a given platform, and any public/leaked info connected to them.
