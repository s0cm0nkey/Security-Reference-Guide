## **Miscellaneous Utilities**

* OSINT Browser Extensions
  * [https://github.com/ninoseki/mitaka](https://github.com/ninoseki/mitaka)
  * [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sputnik/manapjdamopgbpimgojkccikaabhmocd?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sputnik/manapjdamopgbpimgojkccikaabhmocd?hl=en)
  * [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threatpinch-lookup/ljdgplocfnmnofbhpkjclbefmjoikgke?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threatpinch-lookup/ljdgplocfnmnofbhpkjclbefmjoikgke?hl=en)
* [https://www.webgap.io/](https://www.webgap.io/) - Remote browser service providing 12 months of free access for OSINT researchers.
* [Hunchly](https://hunch.ly/) - Web capture tool that passively records web pages as you browse. Useful for tracking large volumes of pages or preserving content that may change after your visit.
* [Carbon14](https://github.com/Lazza/Carbon14) - OSINT tool for estimating when a web page was written. Common CMS platforms easily allow modification of displayed content dates, affecting both websites and RSS feeds. Since the dynamic nature of most web pages prevents investigators from reliably using the `Last-Modified` HTTP header, this tool leverages the `Last-Modified` header of linked images to estimate the time period spent preparing content. This can be compared against CMS-displayed dates to detect discrepancies.
