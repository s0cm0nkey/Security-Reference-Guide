# Asset and Vulnerability Management

## Asset Management

### Sources of Asset Data

* ARP Cache - Contains IP and MAC addresses
* DHCP logs - IP addresses and Hostnames
* NMAP Scans - IP Addresses, Open Ports, Running Services, and Operating System detection
* Powershell commands - System information, installed software, network configuration, and user details
* SNMP - Device information, network statistics, and system status
* Vulnerability Management Software
* Windows Management Interface
* EDR/IR Tools (Velociraptor)

### Management Tools

* [Netdisco](http://netdisco.org/) - Netdisco is a web-based network management tool suitable for small to very large networks. IP and MAC address data is collected into a PostgreSQL database using SNMP, CLI, or device APIs.
* [runZero](https://www.runzero.com/) - (Formerly Rumble) Simple, fast, and accurate asset inventory and network discovery. Uses unauthenticated active scanning.

### MAC Address Lookup

* [MAC Vendor Lookup](https://www.macvendorlookup.com/) - Look up the vendor for a specific MAC Address
* [macvendors.com](https://macvendors.com/) - Find MAC Address Vendors.
* [macaddress.io](https://macaddress.io/) - MAC address vendor lookup
* [maclookup.app](https://maclookup.app/) - Find the vendor name of a device by entering an OUI or a MAC address

### Scanning Techniques

*   **Authenticated Scanning**: The scanner logs into the target system using credentials (SSH, SMB, etc.) to inspect installed software, configurations, and patches from the inside. This provides the most accurate results and reduces false positives.
*   **Unauthenticated Scanning**: The scanner assesses the target from the network perspective without logging in. It identifies open ports, services, and vulnerabilities exposed to the network but misses internal configuration issues.
*   **Agent-based Scanning**: Lightweight software agents are installed on endpoints to report system state and vulnerabilities to a central server. This allows for continuous monitoring even when devices are off the corporate network.

### Vulnerability Databases & Intelligence

* [Rapid7 Vulnerability & Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/) is a curated repository of vetted computer software exploits and exploitable vulnerabilities. Technical details for over 180,000 vulnerabilities and 4,000 exploits are available for security professionals and researchers to review.

### Risk Scoring & Prioritization

*   [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) - A living list of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild. A critical resource for prioritizing remediation.
*   [EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)](https://www.first.org/epss/) - A data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild.
*   [SSVC (Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization)](https://github.com/CERTCC/SSVC) - A decision tree model for prioritizing vulnerability response based on exploitation status, technical impact, safety impact, and mission prevalence.
*   [CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)](https://www.first.org/cvss/) - The industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities.


### Standards and Supply Chain Security

*   **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)**: A structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages.
*   **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**: A comprehensive inventory of software components, dependencies, and licenses. Key formats include [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) and [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/). Crucial for identifying risks in the software supply chain.
